Please read through the key files in this repository to understand its structure and purpose. This will help you provide better assistance for this specific codebase.

Follow these steps:

1. Read the main README.md to understand the overall purpose and structure
2. Explore the concept_library/ directory to understand the concepts being developed
   - For each subdirectory in concept_library/, identify its specific purpose
   - Note how each concept is implemented as a standalone utility
3. Examine the src/ directory to see the implemented CLI utilities
   - Understand how these are more refined implementations of concepts
   - Look for patterns in how concepts transition from experimental to production
4. Review CLAUDE.md for specific guidelines on working with this codebase

After analyzing these files, provide a summary of:
- The repository's purpose and design philosophy
- The key concepts being explored in concept_library/
- The purpose of each directory within the repository
- How the src/ directory implements these concepts
- How these components work together
- What tasks I might be working on based on recent commits

Please be concise and specific to this codebase in your response. Focus on understanding that this is a testing ground for concepts that may eventually be implemented in the main CLI utility. The transition from concept to implementation follows specific patterns that should be maintained when working on this code.
