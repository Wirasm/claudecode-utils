Please read through the key files in this repository to understand its structure and purpose.

This repository is a concept library for building Claude Code CLI utilities.
We explore whats possible with claude code in the concept_library/ directory.
building minimal wrappers with 0 to minimal validation.

improve step by step, and if we like the concept in the concept_library/ directory, we move it to the dylan/ directory and build it into the main CLI.

Follow these steps:

1. Read the main README.md to understand the overall purpose and structure
2. Explore the concept_library/ directory briefly to understand the concepts being developed
   - For each subdirectory in concept_library/, identify its specific purpose
   - Note how each concept is implemented as a standalone utility
3. Examine the dylan/ directory more deeply to see the implemented CLI utilities
   - Understand how these are more refined implementations of concepts
   - Look for patterns in how concepts transition from experimental to production
4. Review CLAUDE.md for specific guidelines on working with this codebase

After analyzing these files, provide a summary of:

- The repository's purpose and design philosophy
- The key concepts being explored in concept_library/
- The purpose of each directory within the repository
- How the dylan/ directory implements these concepts
- How these components work together
- What tasks I might be working on based on recent commits
