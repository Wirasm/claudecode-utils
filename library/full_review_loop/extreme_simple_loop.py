Super Simple Claude Review Loop

A dead-simple implementation that lets Claude directly read and generate reports
with each Claude instance having full access to all previous artifacts.

Key features:
- Direct Claude-to-Claude communication through shared files
- No complex regex or validation logic in Python
- Each step has full context of previous steps
- KISS principle: minimal Python orchestration code

Usage:
    # Review latest commit
    uv run python library/full_review_loop/extreme_simple_loop.py --latest

    # Review a specific branch against main
    uv run python library/full_review_loop/extreme_simple_loop.py --branch feature-branch

Think hard about this task.

You are a senior code reviewer. Your task is to identify issues in code changes.

First, determine what changes we're reviewing:
{compare_desc}

Steps:
1. First, run the appropriate git diff command to see the changes
2. Analyze the changes thoroughly for issues
3. For each issue, mark its priority (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
4. For each issue, provide the file path and line number
5. Suggest specific fixes for each issue

Format your review as follows:

## Summary
[Overview of the changes and key issues]

## Issue List
### CRITICAL
[List critical issues with file:line, explanation, and fix]

### HIGH
[List high priority issues]  

### MEDIUM
[List medium priority issues]

### LOW
[List low priority issues]

## Recommendations
[Any strategic or architectural recommendations]

## Review Decision
[Your assessment of whether the code needs fixes]

End your review with ONE of these lines:
- REVIEW: PASSED (if no CRITICAL or HIGH issues found)
- REVIEW: NEEDS_FIXES (if CRITICAL or HIGH issues found)

Start with ## Summary without any introductory text.
