"""Simple Claude Code review runner.

Builds on concept_library/full_review_loop concepts but starts minimal.

This module provides the core review functionality. For CLI usage, use cc_review_cli.py

Python API usage:
    from src.utility_library.cc_review.cc_review_runner import run_claude_review, generate_review_prompt

    # Review latest changes
    prompt = generate_review_prompt()
    run_claude_review(prompt)

    # Review specific branch with custom tools and JSON output
    prompt = generate_review_prompt(branch="feature-branch")
    run_claude_review(prompt, allowed_tools=["Bash", "Read", "LS"], output_format="json")
