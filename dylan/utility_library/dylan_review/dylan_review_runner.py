"""Simple Claude Code review runner.

Builds on concept_library/full_review_loop concepts but starts minimal.

This module provides the core review functionality. For CLI usage, use dylan_review_cli.py

Python API usage:
    from dylan.utility_library.dylan_review.dylan_review_runner import run_claude_review, generate_review_prompt

    # Review latest changes
    prompt = generate_review_prompt()
    run_claude_review(prompt)

    # Review specific branch with custom tools and JSON output
    prompt = generate_review_prompt(branch="feature-branch")
    run_claude_review(prompt, allowed_tools=["Bash", "Read", "LS"], output_format="json")

BRANCH STRATEGY DETECTION:
1. Check for .branchingstrategy file in repository root
2. If found, parse release_branch (typically: develop) and use as base for comparison
3. If not found, check for common development branches (develop, development, dev)
4. If none found, fall back to main/master
5. Report which base branch was selected

IMPORTANT FILE HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Save your report to the tmp/ directory
- CRITICAL: Get current branch name and include it in filename
- Base filename format: tmp/review_report_<branch_name>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS{extension}
- Replace slashes in branch name with dashes (e.g., feature/foo â†’ feature-foo)
- Use the Bash tool to check if the file exists first
- Always create a new file with timestamp for each review

Please:
1. Get current branch name: git symbolic-ref --short HEAD
2. Sanitize branch name for filename (replace / with -)
3. Create filename: tmp/review_report_<sanitized_branch>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS{extension}
4. Detect the correct base branch following the BRANCH STRATEGY DETECTION steps
5. Use git diff to see the changes from the detected base branch
6. Identify any issues, bugs, or improvements
7. Provide specific feedback with file and line references
8. Suggest concrete fixes where applicable

Provide your review with the following metadata:
- Report metadata:
    - Report file name
    - Report relative path
    - Branch name
    - Base branch used for comparison
    - List of changed files
    - Date range
    - Number of commits
    - List of commits and their id and message
    - Number of files changed
    - Number of lines added
    - Number of lines removed
- Issue metadata:
    - Issue ID (FORMAT: 001, 002, ...)
    - Affected files list
    - Issue types found (bug, security, performance, style, etc.)
    - Overall severity (critical, high, medium, low)
    - Number of issues found
    - Status (open, fixed, in progress)

Rank the issues by severity and provide a summary of the most critical issues.

For each issue, provide:
- A short description
- A list of affected files
- A list of affected lines
- A list of suggested fixes

**ENSURE YOU ALWAYS RETURN THE FILE NAME AND RELATIVE PATH AS PART OF THE REPORT METADATA**
