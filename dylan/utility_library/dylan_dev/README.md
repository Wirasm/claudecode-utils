# Dylan Dev

A module for the Dylan CLI that automates the implementation of fixes based on code reviews generated by the `dylan review` command.

## Overview

The `dylan dev` command takes a review file generated by `dylan review` and automatically implements fixes for issues identified in the review, prioritizing critical and high-severity issues by default. It integrates seamlessly with the existing Dylan CLI workflow.

## Usage

```bash
# Implement fixes from a review file
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md

# Implement fixes on a specific branch
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md --branch feature-branch

# Only fix critical issues
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md --severity "critical"

# Only fix specific issues
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md --issue "001, 002"

# Run in interactive mode
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md --interactive

# Preview changes without applying any fixes
dylan dev tmp/dylan-review-compare-feature-branch-to-develop.md --dry-run
```

## Options

- `REVIEW_FILE`: Path to the review file to use as input (required)
- `--branch, -b`: Branch to apply fixes to (defaults to current branch)
- `--output, -o`: Custom output file path for dev report (defaults to tmp/dylan-dev-report-<branch>.md)
- `--issue, -i`: Specify issue numbers from the review file to fix (comma-separated issue numbers 001, 002, ...)
- `--severity, -s`: Only fix issues with specified severity (default: high and critical) (comma-separated: critical, high, medium, low)
- `--interactive`: Run in interactive mode
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without applying any fixes
- `--debug, -d`: Print debug information (including the full prompt)

## Development Process

The `dylan dev` command:

1. Reads the review file to understand the issues
2. Filters issues based on severity and issue numbers
3. Implements fixes for each issue using Claude Code
4. Verifies that fixes work correctly
5. Generates a development report detailing the changes made

## Output

The command generates a development report with the following sections:

1. Summary
   - Overview of fixes implemented
   - Number of issues fixed per severity level
   - Brief description of approach taken

2. Fixed Issues
   - Section for each severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - For each issue:
     - Issue ID and description from the review
     - Files modified
     - Changes made
     - Explanation of how the fix addresses the issue

3. Verification
   - Description of how fixes were verified
   - Results of any tests run

4. Issues Not Fixed
   - Any issues that couldn't be fixed and why
   - Recommendations for addressing them

5. Next Steps
   - Suggested follow-up actions
   - Any potential improvements beyond the scope of the current fixes

## Integration with Dylan Workflow

The `dylan dev` command is part of the complete Dylan workflow:

1. `dylan review`: Generate a code review identifying issues
2. `dylan dev`: Implement fixes for identified issues
3. `dylan pr`: Create a pull request with the implemented fixes

This end-to-end workflow automates the process of improving code quality with AI assistance.
