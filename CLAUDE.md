# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle enables flexibility and testability.

Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Design your systems so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

KEEP early versions of new concepts in the concept_library/ directory very light and simple.
we add complexity step by step and only if needed.

Minimal claude code wrappers with 0 to minimal validation.

- Always remember to use uv run when we run scripts
- We never write commit messages, we have a pre-commit hook for that so always commit with git commit nothing more

Example:

```bash
claude -p "make a hello.js script that prints hello" --allowedTools "Write" "Edit"
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script

import subprocess

prompt = """

GIT checkout a NEW branch.

CREATE src/cc_todo/todo.py: a zero library CLI todo app with basic CRUD.

THEN GIT stage, commit and SWITCH back to main.

"""

command = ["claude", "-p", prompt, "--allowedTools", "Edit", "Bash", "Write"]

process = subprocess.run(command, check=True)

print(f"Claude process exited with output: {process.stdout}")
```

Tools available to Claude
Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

Permission rules can be configured using /allowed-tools or in permission settings.

So as you can see we can get claude code to do almost anything just using natural language and explicit prompting.

## Code Architecture

Dylan is a modular CLI for AI-powered development utilities using Claude Code. The project explores three core concepts:

### 1. Automated Review Flow

The architecture follows a pipeline approach with these main components:

1. **Simple Review**: Code review tool generating feedback for git branches or commits

   - `simple_review_poc.py`: Proof-of-concept implementation
   - `simple_review.py`: Enhanced implementation with config options

2. **Simple Developer**: Implements fixes based on review feedback

   - Prioritizes critical and high-priority issues identified in reviews

3. **Simple Validator**: Validates that fixes properly address review issues

   - Generates validation reports with PASS/FAIL determinations

4. **Simple PR**: Creates pull requests based on validated changes

   - Generates comprehensive PR descriptions from development reports

5. **Full Review Loop**: Orchestrates complete workflow with multiple Claude instances
   - `full_review_loop_safe.py`: Creates isolated environments (temporary branches and worktrees)
   - Implements iterative improvement cycles: Review → Develop → Re-Review → Validate

Key architectural principles:

- Each component is designed to function independently
- Components communicate through structured markdown reports
- Safety features include temporary branch creation and worktree isolation
- The workflow follows a progressive refinement pattern, where validation results feed back into development

### 2. Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Flow

The PRP Flow is a sophisticated agentic engineering workflow for implementing complete features:

- **Key Concept**: "Over-specifying what to build while under-specifying the context is why so many AI-driven coding attempts stall at 80%. A Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) fixes that by fusing the disciplined scope of a traditional Product Requirements Document (PRD) with the 'context-is-king' mindset of modern prompt engineering."

- **Structure**:

  - **Context**: Precise file paths, library versions, code snippets
  - **Implementation Details**: Clear guidance on how to build the feature
  - **Validation Gates**: Deterministic checks for quality control

- **Components**:
  - PRP templates in the PRPs/ directory
  - Runner scripts in concept_library/cc_PRP_flow/scripts/
  - Support for both interactive and headless modes

### 3. Standup Automation

A tool for generating daily standup reports from git activity:

- Collects recent git commits and PR activity
- Uses Claude to generate structured Markdown reports
- Supports customizable date ranges
- Automatically formats reports with Yesterday/Today/Blockers sections
