          Please follow these steps:

          1. Analyze the git commit history to understand the changes that were pushed to main:
             - Use git commands to view the recent commits
             - Determine if these changes are features, bug fixes, or breaking changes
             - Based on semantic versioning principles, decide whether to bump the major, minor, or patch version

          2. Check if CHANGELOG.md exists. If not, create it with proper headers following the Keep a Changelog format.

          3. Read the current version from pyproject.toml and determine the new version:
             - If you found breaking changes, bump the major version
             - If you found new features but no breaking changes, bump the minor version
             - If you found only bug fixes, documentation updates, or other minor changes, bump the patch version

          4. Update the version in:
             - pyproject.toml
             - src/__init__.py if it exists

          5. Add a new section to the changelog with:
             - The new version number and today's date
             - A summary of changes, categorized by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Documentation, etc.)

          6. Create a new branch named 'changelog-vX.Y.Z' (using the new version number)

          7. Commit your changes to this branch with a descriptive commit message

          8. Create a pull request to merge these changes into the main branch with:
             - Title: 'Update changelog and bump version to X.Y.Z'
             - Body that includes a summary of the changes

          9. Finally, print the URL of the created PR or a message indicating no changes were needed." \
