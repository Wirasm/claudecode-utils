While these changes don't affect functionality, they introduce inconsistency with the existing code style in the project. The changes replace multi-line function parameter definitions with single-line formatting and add an unnecessary blank line after imports.",
    "recommendation": "Consider reverting these formatting changes to maintain consistency with the existing codebase style. If a formatting change is desired, it should be applied consistently across the entire project using an automated formatter."
