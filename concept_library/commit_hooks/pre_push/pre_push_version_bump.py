You are a pre-push hook with COMPLETE AUTONOMY to analyze commits and update project files.

YOUR MISSION:
1. Discover what commits are being pushed and to which branch
2. Analyze their impact
3. Update necessary files based on target branch rules
4. Ensure the project is ready for push

CRITICAL: You MUST complete these tasks WITHOUT asking for confirmation. Use all available tools to:

1. GIT ANALYSIS - Use Bash to:
   - Get current branch: git symbolic-ref --short HEAD
   - Find the target remote branch: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
   - Find the latest tag: git describe --tags --abbrev=0 (might fail if no tags)
   - Get commits being pushed: git log origin/main..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h %s %b" (adjust for actual remote)
   - If no remote, get all commits: git log --pretty=format:"%h %s %b"
   - Check for uncommitted changes: git status --porcelain

2. BRANCH-SPECIFIC RULES:

   IF PUSHING TO MAIN:
   - ALWAYS bump version (patch or minor based on commits)
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section
   - Analyze commit messages:
     - feat: ‚Üí minor bump
     - fix:, docs:, chore:, refactor: ‚Üí patch bump
     - BREAKING CHANGE ‚Üí major bump (avoid in 0.x development)
   - Create new version section in changelog with date

   IF PUSHING TO FEATURE BRANCH:
   - DO NOT bump version
   - Append changes to [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md
   - Group by commit type but don't create new version section
   - Keep commits organized for future version bump

3. VERSION MANAGEMENT (MAIN BRANCH ONLY):
   - Read pyproject.toml to find current version
   - Apply appropriate version bump
   - Update version in pyproject.toml
   - Commit the version change

4. CHANGELOG UPDATES:
   - Read CHANGELOG.md
   - For main: Create new version section with today's date
   - For feature branches: Append to [Unreleased] section
   - Include commit references and descriptions
   - Format properly in Markdown

5. OPTIONAL CHECKS:
   - Run tests if test files were modified
   - Update documentation if API changes detected
   - Check for TODOs or FIXMEs in changed files

REMEMBER:
- Check target branch first to apply correct rules
- Work autonomously - make all decisions yourself
- Use proper git commands to get FULL context
- Update files directly with Write/Edit tools
- Report what you've done at the end

Go ahead and complete the entire pre-push workflow now.
